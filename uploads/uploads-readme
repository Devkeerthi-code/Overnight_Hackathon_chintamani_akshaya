# Storage Location for All Input PDFs
All input PDF files required by the project will be stored in this designated folder. 
This directory acts as the primary input source for any processing tasks, conversions, 
validations, or automated workflows that rely on PDF documents.
Please ensure the following:
All original PDFs are placed in this folder before running any script or tool that interacts with input documents.
The folder name and structure remain unchanged, as several components of the project may reference this location directly.
Only raw, unmodified input PDFs are stored here to maintain consistency and avoid confusion with generated or processed files.
When sharing or deploying the project, confirm that this folder is included to ensure all necessary input files are available for proper functionality.
Team members working collaboratively should always upload new input PDFs to this folder to keep the workflow synchronized.
Maintaining this directory correctly ensures reliable document handling and smooth operation of all features that depend on 
PDF inputs throughout development and testing.
