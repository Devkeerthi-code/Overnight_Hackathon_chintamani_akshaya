# Downloading the static-java Folders
To ensure the project runs smoothly and all Java-related components function as intended, 
please download all static-java folders from the provided source. These folders contain 
essential Java resources required for backend logic, application processing, and various 
runtime operations. Once downloaded, place each folder in the appropriate directory as 
outlined in the project structure. It is important that you do not modify the folder 
names, file paths, or internal file arrangements, as doing so may lead to errors during 
compilation or execution. After transferring the folders, take a moment to verify file 
completeness and integrity, ensuring that no files are missing or corrupted. This step 
helps maintain consistent behavior across development, testing, and deployment environments.
Proper inclusion of the static-java folders is crucial for enabling full application functionality 
and supporting seamless integration with other modules within the project.
