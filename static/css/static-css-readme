Downloading the static-css Folders
To ensure the project functions correctly and all styling resources are available, please download all static-css folders from the provided source. 
After downloading, place the folders in the appropriate project directory as indicated in the repository structure.

## Make sure that:
    Each static-css folder is fully downloaded without missing files.
    The directory names and file paths remain unchanged.
    You verify the integrity of the downloaded files to avoid inconsistencies in styling or rendering.
    The folders are stored securely and included in your working environment before running or deploying the project.
    These assets are essential for maintaining consistent UI behavior, responsive layout performance, and proper rendering across the application.
