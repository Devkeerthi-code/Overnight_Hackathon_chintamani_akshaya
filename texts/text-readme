# Storage Location for Converted Text Files
All PDFs that undergo text conversion will be stored in a designated folder within the project directory. 
This folder serves as the central repository for all extracted text files, ensuring that converted content is organized, 
easy to locate, and accessible for further processing or review.
Please ensure that:
The folder path remains unchanged to avoid breaking references within the project.
Only converted text output from PDFs is stored here to maintain a clean and consistent structure.
The directory is included when cloning, pulling, or deploying the project so that all team members can access the converted resources.
Any automated scripts or tools that rely on these text files are configured to read from this folder.
Maintaining this folder properly helps streamline workflow, enhances collaboration, and ensures reliable access to all 
converted text resources throughout the development lifecycle.
